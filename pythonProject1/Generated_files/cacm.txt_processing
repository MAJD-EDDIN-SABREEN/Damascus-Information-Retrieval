in a recent paper bellman show how dynam 
program could be use to determin the solut

compris the determin given n of the 
n point of subdivis of a given interv ab and 
the correspond line segment that give the 
best least squar fit to a function g x in the interv 
bellman confin himself primarili to the 
analyt deriv suggest briefli howev 
how the solut of the equat deriv for each 
particular point of subdivis u i could be reduc to 
a discret search in thi paper the comput 
procedur is consid more fulli and the similar 
to some of stone equat are indic 
it is further shown that an equat for u i involv 
no minim may be found in addit 
it is shown how bellman method may be appli to the

cooley and tukey have propos a fast algorithm 
for comput complex fourier transform and 
have shown major time save in use it to comput 
larg transform on a digit comput with n 
a power of two comput time for thi algorithm is 
proport to n log2 n a major improv over 
other method with comput time proport to n2 
in thi paper the fast fourier transform algorithm 
is briefli review and fast differ equat method 
for accur comput the need trigonometr 
function valu are given the problem of comput 
a larg fourier transform on a system with virtual 
memori is consid and a solut is propos thi 
method ha been use to comput complex fourier 
transform of size n 216 on a comput with 215 
word of core storag thi exce by a factor of 
eight the maximum radix two transform size with fix 
alloc of thi amount of core storag the

accept a input descript of the multicharact 
item or of word allow in a languag given in term 
of a subset of regular express the output 
of the system is a lexic processor which read a string 
of charact and combin them into the item 
a defin by the regular express each output 
item is identifi by a code number togeth with 
a pointer to a block of storag contain the charact

an effici method of order retriev of binari 
word from an associ memori a describ

which indic the digit valu present in 
the individu digit column of the memori thu the 
circuit indic whether the individu digit 
column contain digit of both valu or of onli one 
valu or contain no digit at all ie that the 
memori is empti the use of these circuit which 
in thi paper are term column valu indic

to retriev in order a number of distinct 
word from the memori lewin prove that for the readout 
by the describ method of m distinct binari

each use the same central processor unit 
cpu and input output io channel these program 
are actual proceed intermitt and singli 
accord to elig readi to proceed and prioriti 
it is use to be abl to repres them 
a proceed continu and simultan each 
at an effect rate which may be a fraction of 
that which it would enjoy in the absenc of the other 
program the effect progress rate of each 
program is sensit to mani detail characterist 
of itself and it co resid and simul ha 
been the best avail method of predict it thi 
paper present the result of progress in develop 
an altern to simul a simul test iter 
comput of these rate under certain 
situat the algorithm is sensit to most of the 
factor that control the phenomenon includ

be analyt an introduct to thi method is 
given and a critic review of relat literatur is 
present although in theori the method alway 
converg it is shown that a fundament dilemma exist 
which may caus a breakdown in practic applic 
to avoid thi difficulti and to improv the rate of

a note on storag fragment and program segment 
.W
the main purpos of thi paper is the present 
of some of the result of a seri of simul 
experi investig the phenomenon of storag fragment 
two differ type of storag fragment 
are distinguish 1 extern fragment name the 
loss in storag util caus by the inabl 
to make use of all avail storag after it ha been 
fragment into a larg number of separ block 
and 2 intern fragment the loss of util 
caus by round up a request for storag 
rather than alloc onli the exact number of word requir 
the most strike result is the appar 
gener rule that round up request for storag 
to reduc the number of differ size of block 
coexist in storag caus more loss of storag 
by increas intern fragment than is save 
by decreas extern fragment describ also are 
a method of segment alloc and an accompani 
techniqu for segment address which take advantag 
of the abov result evid is present of 
possibl advantag of the method over convent page techniqu

the servic receiv by a process from a time share 
oper system can be character 
by a resourc count sumwirij where rij is the 
number of unit of servic receiv by process 
i from resourc i and wi is the cost per unit of the 
servic each class of user can be character 
by a polici function which specifi the amount of servic 
a user who belong to thi class should receiv 
a a function of time prioriti chang dynam 
a a function of the differ between the servic 
promis to the user by the polici function and the servic

abov it polici function will provid the specifi 
level of servic overhead can be reduc by avoid

array are inher well suit for the solut

matrix of a graph is easili map onto an array 
each matrix element is store in one cell of the array 
and typic row and column oper are readili 
implement by simpl cell logic a major challeng 
in the effect use of cellular array for the 
solut of graph problem is the determin of algorithm 
that exploit the possibl for parallel 
especi for problem whose solut appear to be inher 
serial in particular sever parallel 
algorithm are present for the solut of certain 
span tree distanc and path problem with 
direct applic to wire rout pert chart analysi 
and the analysi of mani type of network 
these algorithm exhibit a comput time that in

pose an optim problem in the design of 
such tree to serv a well specifi applic the 
problem is academ in the sen that ordinarili 
the optim tree cannot be implement by mean of practic 
techniqu on the other hand it is potenti 
use for the comparison it afford between observ

ideal search procedur a a practic applic 
of such a model thi paper consid the design of 
a novel tree search scheme base on a bit vector represent

explicit user control facil for program test 
to accommod these extens to pli without 
abandon compat with ibm compil plc permit 
pseudo comment construct whose content 
can option be consid either sourc test or comment 
in spite of the diagnost effort plc is 
a fast and effici processor it effect demonstr 
that compil can provid better diagnost

comput gener of gamma random variat 
with non integr shape paramet 
.W
when the shape paramet a is integr 
gener gamma random variabl with a digit 
comput is straightforward there is no simpl method 
for gener gamma random variat with non integr 
shape paramet a common procedur is to approxim 
gener such random variabl by use of the 
so call probabl switch method anoth procedur 
which is exact is due to johnk thi paper 
present a reject method for exactli gener 
gamma random variabl when a is greater than 1 
the effici of the reject method is shown to 
be better than the effici of johnk method 
the paper conclud that when a is non integr the follow 
mix of procedur yield the best combin 
of accuraci and effici 1 when a is le than 
1 use johnk method 2 when 1 is le than a 
and a is le than 5 use the reject method 3 when 
a is greater than 5 use the probabl switch

the other node are associ with choic poin t 
accord to the propos program style a gener 
function is associ with each choic poin t 
which express the desir choic strategi the main 
advantag on thi approach is the local 
of the search strategi each nontermin node of the 
tree keep track of the state of the comput

is present with a number of exampl of correct

simpler than their convent counterpart 
on the other hand it is shown that a proof of correct

how the intermitt assert method can be appli 
to prove the valid of program transform

an algorithm for insert an element into a one side height balanc 
oshb binari search tree is present the algorithm oper in time

ly known insert algorithm of hirschberg and kosaraju which requir 
time o log 2n moreov the o log n complex is optim earlier 
result have shown that delet in such a structur can 
also be perform in o log n time thu the result of thi paper 
give a neg answer to the question of whether such tree should 
be the first exampl of their kind where delet ha a smaller time 
complex than insert furthermor it can now be conclud 
that insert delet and retriev in oshb tree can 
be perform in the same time a the correspond oper for 
the more gener avl tree to within a constant factor howev 
the insert and delet algorithm for oshb tree appear much 
more complic than the correspond algorithm for avl tree
